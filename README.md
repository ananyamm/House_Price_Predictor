# House_Price_Predictor
   
# Introduction

A Machine Learning model to predict the house prices using supervised learning technique. I'll also create a single page website which will provide the front end to access our model for predictions.   

### The aim of this project is to

•	Visualize and cleaning the given dataset  
•	Build a model to make the prediction for the house price with given significant predictor variables using Python, Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms  
•	to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.  
•	Create a website in html, CSS and JavaScript that allows user to enter home, square ft area, bathrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.  

### Technology and tools used in this project:

•	Python  
•	Visual Studio  
•	NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning  
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
•	Scikit-learn (Sklearn) for model building  
•	Pickle  
•	Python flask for http server  
•	HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UI  
•	GitHub  

# Steps

•	Import the required libraries    
•	Load the dataset  
•	Clean the data   
•	Build Machine Learning Model  
•	Export the Model   
•	a python flask server to serve http requests  
•	Python flask for http server  
•	Website built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript to retrieve information  

## Dataset Reference

I have uploaded the csv file in this repository [house_price.csv](https://github.com/ananyamm/House_Price_Predictor/blob/main/house_price.csv)
